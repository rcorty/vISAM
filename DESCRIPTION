Title: Weighted Inbred Strain Association Mapping

Description: In the course of an inbred strain association mapping study,
    there may be more information about the mean phenotype of some strains
    than about others.  This situation arises when there is heterogeneity
    in the number of observations per strain, or in the residual variance
    across strains.  This packaged allows the user to conduct an
    association mapping study that accounts for this heterogeneity of 
    precision.
